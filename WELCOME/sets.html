            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In Python, a set is a collection of unique elements that are unordered and mutable.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Sets are represented by curly braces {}, with the values enclosed within the braces.     
                Developers often choose sets over a list because it is optimal for checking whether a specific
                element is contained in the set.      
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Set Example</h3>
            <p>
                my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
                <br>
                <br>

                my_set.add(6)
                <br>
                print(my_set) #Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
                <br>
                <br>

                my_set.remove(2)
                <br>
                print(my_set) #Output: {1, 3, 4, 5}
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Hashing</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="images/hashing.png" alt="Hashing">
            </p>
            <p>
                Since sets are unordered, you cannot access items using indexes the way you would in lists. In order to check
                if an element is contained in the set, you need to use a hash table.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Hashing is a popular technique for storing and retrieving data as quickly as possible, typically in O(1) time. 
                Hashing is a solution that can be used in almost all situations and performs extremely well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some common hashing components are the hash table, which gives the functionality in which a collection of data is stored
                so it is easier to search and find elements later; the hash function, which maps each key into a unique slot index; and chaining, which 
                makes each cell of a hash table point to a linked list of records that have the same hash function value. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Hashing Example</h3>
            <p>
                my_set = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
                <br>
                print(hash(my_set)) 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Union</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="images/union.png" alt="Union">
            </p>
            <p>
                In Python, the union method returns a new set that contains all the items from the original set. 
                The union of two given sets is the set that contains all the elements of both. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Union does not include duplicate values in the resulting set. 
                The union is denoted by the "|" operator. 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Union Example</h3>
            <p>
                set1 = {1, 2, 3}
                <br>
                set2 = {3, 4, 5}
                <br>
                <br>

                set3 = set1 | set2
                <br>
                print(set3) #Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Intersection</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="images/intersection.png" alt="Intersection">
            </p>
            <p>
                In Python, the intersection method returns a new set with an element that is common to all sets. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                The intersection of two given sets is the largest set, which contains all the elements that are common to both. 
                The intersection is denoted by .intersection(). 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Intersection Example</h3>
            <p>
                set1 = {1, 3, 4}
                <br>
                set2 = {3, 4, 5}
                <br>
                <br>

                set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
                <br>

                print(set3) #Output: {3, 4}
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
